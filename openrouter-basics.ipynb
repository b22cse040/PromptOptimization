The vagueness suggests they might not want a clinical answer but something that resonates emotionally while still being thoughtful. \\n\\nThere are multiple layers I could approach:\\nThe scientific perspective (biological purpose) - but that feels too reductionist for this query\\nThe religious framework - but that might not align with user\\'s beliefs\\nThe humanist/philosophical angle - seems most balanced, acknowledging both structure and freedom\\nIncluding some poetic/random elements too since the question itself is somewhat abstract\\n\\nNeed to balance depth with accessibility - no jargon, but not simplistic either. Should acknowledge the uncertainty while offering constructive possibilities. The \"existential void\" reference might help frame this as a universal human experience rather than just my opinion.\\n\\nInteresting how I naturally organized it from structured (biological/religious) to open-ended (philosophical/random). That progression mirrors how people often approach big questions - starting with concrete frameworks before embracing ambiguity. \\n\\nShould maintain an open tone at the end - not prescribing answers, just reflecting what philosophers throughout history have contemplated.
