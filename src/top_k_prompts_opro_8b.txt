Recommendations:
 
1. Revise the fluency instruction to explicitly mention the importance of grammatical correctness, proper sentence structure, and clear language, as the current instruction only touches on these aspects briefly.
2. Clarify the definition of coherence by providing explicit examples of logical transitions, such as explaining that transitions should connect related ideas between sentences and paragraphs, or provide concrete guidance on what constitutes a logical flow.
3. Provide more emphasis on the importance of factual accuracy and consistency in the consistency metric definition, as the current instruction focuses more on logical transitions.
4. Revise the relevance instruction to include specific examples of key points and essential aspects, and provide clear guidance on how to identify and capture them, as the current instruction is quite general.
5. Highlight logical transitions as the most critical aspect of coherence and provide an example of what makes a good logical transition, since the model is most struggling with coherence (CE_coherence = 1.914).

This instruction would highlight coherence more and have a higher cross entropy loss, making adjustments there even more beneficial to model performance.
