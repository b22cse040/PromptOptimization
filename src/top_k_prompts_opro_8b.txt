Recommendations:

1. The current instruction is being lenient, as indicated by the high mean_diff scores for all metrics (ranging from 1.25 to 3.5). To address this, the instruction should be revised to emphasize the importance of accuracy and strict adherence to the evaluation criteria.

2. The instruction could be clarified to specify that the evaluation of coherence should focus on the logical transitions between sentences, as the current performance suggests that the model is struggling to capture this aspect.

3. The instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on how to evaluate consistency, as the current performance suggests that the model is inconsistent in its evaluation of this metric.

4. The instruction could be revised to provide more specific guidance on how to evaluate relevance, as the current performance suggests that the model is struggling to capture this aspect.

5. The instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on how to evaluate fluency, as the current performance suggests that the model is struggling to capture this aspect.

6. The instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on how to evaluate the overall quality of the summary, as the current performance suggests that the model is struggling to capture this aspect.

7. The instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on how to handle cases where the summary is incomplete or lacks key information, as the current performance suggests that the model is struggling to evaluate these cases.

8. The instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on how to handle cases where the summary is overly long or contains unnecessary information, as the current performance suggests that the model is struggling to evaluate these cases.

9. The instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on how to evaluate the use of language and tone in the summary, as the current performance suggests that the model is struggling to capture this aspect.

10. The instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on how to evaluate the overall impact of the summary, as the current performance suggests that the model is struggling to capture this aspect.

Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency, and consistency of sentences, strictly adhering to the evaluation criteria and considering that a high score indicates that the summary accurately and naturally conveys the key points of the article without introducing any untrue information, with a focus on logical transitions between sentences, accurate reproduction of facts, and the inclusion of all and only the important aspects.

       CE_relevance: 1.977

Recommendations:

1. The current instruction is being lenient in its evaluation, as indicated by the high mean_diff scores for most samples. To address this, the instruction should be revised to emphasize the importance of strict adherence to the evaluation criteria, with a focus on accuracy and attention to detail.
2. The instruction could be clarified to provide more specific guidance on what constitutes "logical transitions between sentences" in the context of coherence. This could include examples or definitions to help raters understand the expectation.
3. The instruction's emphasis on "inclusion of all and only the important aspects" in the relevance metric may be contributing to the low accuracy and f1 scores for this metric. To address this, the instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on how to identify and prioritize key points in a summary.
4. The current instruction does not provide clear guidance on how to evaluate the fluency of individual sentences. To address this, the instruction could be revised to include specific criteria for evaluating sentence-level fluency, such as grammar, syntax, and vocabulary usage.
5. The instruction's focus on "accurate reproduction of facts" in the consistency metric may be contributing to the low accuracy and f1 scores for this metric. To address this, the instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on how to evaluate the accuracy of facts in a summary, including the importance of verifying information through credible sources.

Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency, and consistency of sentences, strictly adhering to the evaluation criteria and considering that a high score indicates that the summary accurately and naturally conveys the key points of the article without introducing any untrue information, with a focus on logical transitions between sentences, accurate reproduction of facts, and the inclusion of all and only the important aspects. When evaluating coherence, pay close attention to the logical flow of ideas and the use of transitional phrases to connect sentences. For relevance, prioritize the inclusion of key points and ensure that the summary does not omit crucial information. In evaluating fluency, assess the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary usage of individual sentences, and consider the overall clarity and readability of the summary. Finally, for consistency, verify the accuracy of facts and ensure that the summary does not introduce any untrue information.

       CE_relevance: 1.91

Recommendations:

1. The current instruction is being lenient in its evaluation, as indicated by the high mean_diff scores for most samples. This suggests that the model is consistently scoring higher than the ground truth, which may not accurately reflect the quality of the summaries. To address this, the instruction should be revised to provide more stringent criteria for evaluation, such as requiring more precise and accurate reproduction of facts, or stricter adherence to logical transitions between sentences.

2. The instruction could be clarified to provide more specific guidance on what constitutes "logical transitions between sentences" in the coherence metric. This could include examples or definitions of what types of transitions are expected, such as cause-and-effect relationships, temporal relationships, or contrastive relationships.

3. The instruction's emphasis on "inclusion of all and only the important aspects" in the relevance metric may be contributing to the high mean_diff scores, as the model may be prioritizing breadth over depth in its summaries. To address this, the instruction could be revised to emphasize the importance of including key points and omitting crucial information, while also considering the overall balance and focus of the summary.

4. The instruction's focus on "accurate reproduction of facts" in the consistency metric may be leading to high mean_diff scores, as the model may be prioritizing factual accuracy over other aspects of the summary. To address this, the instruction could be revised to consider other aspects of consistency, such as the use of consistent tone, style, and language throughout the summary.

5. The instruction's emphasis on "grammar, syntax, and vocabulary usage" in the fluency metric may be contributing to the high mean_diff scores, as the model may be prioritizing individual sentence-level features over the overall coherence and flow of the summary. To address this, the instruction could be revised to consider the overall clarity and readability of the summary, rather than just individual sentence-level features.
