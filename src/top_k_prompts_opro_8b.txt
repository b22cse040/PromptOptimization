Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency, and consistency of sentences, considering that a high score indicates a well-crafted summary that accurately captures the key points of the article without introducing new or inaccurate information. To achieve this, carefully evaluate the logical transitions between sentences for coherence, ensuring that the summary presents a clear and cohesive narrative. Consider the CE_coherence score (< 0.1) and aim to minimize it. A well-crafted summary should have a logical flow of ideas, with each sentence building on the previous one to create a cohesive narrative.

For relevance, assess the summary's ability to capture key points and supporting evidence from the article, while avoiding minor omissions or inaccuracies. Consider the CE_relevance score (< 0.05) and aim to minimize it. A relevant summary should include all the essential information from the article, without introducing new or false information. To achieve this, evaluate the summary's ability to capture the main ideas, supporting evidence, and key points from the article, while avoiding minor omissions or inaccuracies. Provide specific criteria or examples to help evaluate the "key points" of the article for relevance, such as considering the main ideas, supporting evidence, and key points from the article.

For fluency, examine the grammatical correctness, sentence structure, and vocabulary usage in the summary, ensuring that it is well-written and easy to understand. Consider the CE_fluency score (< 0.15) and aim to minimize it. A fluent summary should have grammatically correct sentences, a clear structure, and a suitable vocabulary that facilitates easy comprehension. To achieve this, assess the summary's grammatical correctness, sentence structure, and vocabulary usage, ensuring that it is well-written and easy to understand.

For consistency, verify the accuracy of facts and information presented in the summary, ensuring that it aligns with the original article without introducing new or false information. Consider the CE_consistency score (< 0.2) and aim to minimize it. A consistent summary should accurately represent the facts and information from the article, without introducing any inaccuracies or new information. To achieve this, verify the accuracy of facts and information presented in the summary, ensuring that it aligns with the original article without introducing new or false information.

Be harsher in evaluating fluency, consistency, and relevance, as indicated by the positive mean_diff scores. Emphasize the importance of "logical transitions between sentences" for coherence. Use a more nuanced evaluation approach that takes into account the complexity and coherence of the summary, rather than just its length. Consider the CE_[metric] score and aim to minimize it for each metric. Be more accurate in evaluating the summary's ability to capture key points and supporting evidence from the article for relevance. Be more thorough in verifying the accuracy of facts and information presented in the summary for consistency. Consider the context and content of the summary when evaluating its quality, rather than relying solely on Cross-Entropy Loss scores. Emphasize the importance of accuracy and consistency in the summary, particularly for metrics like consistency and relevance.

Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency, and consistency of sentences, considering that a high score indicates a well-crafted summary that accurately captures the key points of the article without introducing new or inaccurate information. To achieve this, carefully evaluate the logical transitions between sentences for coherence, ensuring that the summary presents a clear and cohesive narrative. Consider the CE_coherence score (< 0.1) and aim to minimize it. A well-crafted summary should have a logical flow of ideas, with each sentence building on the previous one to create a cohesive narrative.

For relevance, assess the summary's ability to capture key points and supporting evidence from the article, while avoiding minor omissions or inaccuracies. Consider the CE_relevance score (< 0.05) and aim to minimize it. A relevant summary should include all the essential information from the article, without introducing new or false information. To achieve this, evaluate the summary's ability to capture the main ideas, supporting evidence, and key points from the article, while avoiding minor omissions or inaccuracies. Provide specific criteria or examples to help evaluate the "key points" of the article for relevance, such as considering the main ideas, supporting evidence, and key points from the article.

For fluency, examine the grammatical correctness, sentence structure, and vocabulary usage in the summary, ensuring that it is well-written and easy to understand. Consider the CE_fluency score (< 0.15) and aim to minimize it. A fluent summary should have grammatically correct sentences, a clear structure, and a suitable vocabulary that facilitates easy comprehension. To achieve this, assess the summary's grammatical correctness, sentence structure, and vocabulary usage, ensuring that it is well-written and easy to understand.

For consistency, verify the accuracy of facts and information presented in the summary, ensuring that it aligns with the original article without introducing new or false information. Consider the CE_consistency score (< 0.2) and aim to minimize it. A consistent summary should accurately represent the facts and information from the article, without introducing any inaccuracies or new information. To achieve this, verify the accuracy of facts and information presented in the summary, ensuring that it aligns with the original article without introducing new or false information.

Be harsher in evaluating fluency, consistency, and relevance, as indicated by the positive mean_diff scores. Emphasize the importance of "logical transitions between sentences" for coherence.

Recommendations:

1. Be more accurate in evaluating the summary's ability to capture key points and supporting evidence from the article for relevance. The current performance suggests leniency in evaluating relevance, with a mean_diff score of 1.75. Consider revising the instruction to emphasize the importance of capturing all essential information from the article without introducing new or false information.
2. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize "logical transitions between sentences" and "cohesive narrative" more explicitly. The current instruction is clear, but the performance suggests that the rater may be lenient in evaluating coherence, with a mean_diff score of 1.75. Consider adding specific criteria or examples to help evaluate the logical transitions between sentences.
3. Be more thorough in verifying the accuracy of facts and information presented in the summary for consistency.
