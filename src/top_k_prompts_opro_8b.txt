4. Consider adding a specific example of a well-structured summary that lacks key information to help the model understand the lower end of the rating scale.
5. Revise the instruction to prioritize the importance of content over polish, but also acknowledge that a well-written summary can be more effective in conveying the author's intent and tone.
6. Provide a clear definition of what constitutes a summary that covers all crucial information, and consider adding specific criteria for evaluating this aspect, such as whether the summary includes all key findings, methods, and conclusions.
