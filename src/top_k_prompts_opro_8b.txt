Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency, and consistency, considering the following criteria:

For coherence, evaluate the logical flow between sentences, the overall quality of sentence structure, and whether sentences are well-organized and clearly connected, regardless of whether transitions are explicitly stated. Award 4 or 5 points if sentences are well-organized and clearly connected, 3 points if they are somewhat connected but not logically, 2 points if they are disconnected or lacking transitions, and 1 point if they are hard to follow.

For relevance, consider not only key points but also context and supporting details. Ensure that all and only the important aspects are captured, and facts are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article. Award 4 or 5 points if the summary captures key points and context, and includes supporting details that are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article, 3 points if it captures most but not all, 2 points if it captures some but not all, and 1 point if it misses key points or includes irrelevant information.

For fluency, assess the quality of individual sentences, including grammar, sentence-level clarity, and overall coherence. Separate the evaluation of sentence-level clarity and overall coherence. Award 4 or 5 points if sentences are well-written, clear, and grammatically correct, 3 points if they are somewhat clear but lack polish, 2 points if they are unclear or grammatically incorrect, and 1 point if they are hard to understand.

For consistency, evaluate the accuracy of facts and whether they are consistently supported by evidence from the original article. Award 4 or 5 points if facts are accurately reproduced and consistently supported, 3 points if they are mostly accurate but occasionally contradicted, 2 points if they are partially accurate but often contradicted, and 1 point if they are frequently or completely contradicted.

Compare the summary to the full article to evaluate relevance, and ensure that facts are accurately reproduced and not contradicted. State the source of information when citing the original article to support consistency. Evaluate the summary in the context of the original article's purpose and scope to improve relevance.

Award high scores for relevance if the summary captures key points, context, and supporting details that are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article. Award high scores for consistency if facts are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article. Award high scores for fluency if sentences are well-written, clear, and grammatically correct. Award high scores for coherence if sentences are well-organized and clearly connected, regardless of whether transitions are explicitly stated.

Award 4 or 5 points for coherence if sentences are well-organized and clearly connected, 3 points if they are somewhat connected but not logically, 2 points if they are disconnected or lacking transitions, and 1 point if they are hard to follow. Award 4 or 5 points for fluency if sentences are well-written, clear, and grammatically correct, 3 points if they are somewhat clear but lack polish, 2 points if they are unclear or grammatically incorrect, and 1 point if they are hard to understand.

Award 4 or 5 points for consistency if facts are accurately reproduced and consistently supported, 3 points if they are mostly accurate but occasionally contradicted, 2 points if they are partially accurate but often contradicted, and 1 point if they are frequently or completely contradicted. Award 4 or 5 points for relevance if the summary captures key points, context, and supporting details that are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article, 3 points if it captures most but not all, 2 points if it captures some but not all, and 1 point if it misses key points or includes irrelevant information.

When evaluating fluency, consider evaluating sentence-level clarity and coherence separately.

Recommendations:
  1. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize "well-organized and clearly connected" with "explicit transitions" for consistency in evaluating transitions, as the CE value suggests a disconnect between the instruction and expert annotators' expectations.
  2. Clarify the relevance instruction to ensure consistency in evaluating "context and supporting details" to improve the accuracy and f1-score of relevance.
  3. Consider awarding 1 point for fluency if sentences are hard to understand, as the current instruction may encourage LLM to assign low scores more frequently, given the high CE value.
  4. Revise the consistency instruction to clearly state that awarding 4 or 5 points requires facts to be "consistently supported by evidence from the original article," to improve the accuracy and f1-score of consistency.

Recommendations:
1. Revise the fluency instruction to emphasize clarity and grammar in a more explicit manner, such as "assess the clarity and grammar of each sentence, considering both the sentence's individual meaning and its contribution to the overall flow of the text."
2. Clarify the coherence metric to require a more explicit consideration of logical transitions between sentences, such as "evaluate the logical flow and explicit connections between sentences, considering whether they contribute to a cohesive and well-organized summary."
3. Refine the relevance metric to better capture context and supporting details, such as "ensure that the summary accurately reproduces key points, context, and supporting details, and that facts are consistently supported by evidence from the original article, including explicit citations or references when necessary."
4. Consider revising the consistency metric to reduce its complexity, as its evaluation appears to be challenging for the model, such as "evaluate the accuracy of facts in the summary and ensure that they are consistently supported by evidence from the original article, with a focus on accurate reproduction and avoidance of contradictions."

Recommendations:
 1. Revise the fluency instruction to explicitly separate the evaluation of sentence-level clarity and sentence-level coherence, as this dual evaluation may be causing confusion and contributing to the low performance.
 
 2. Clarify the definition of fluency in the instruction to ensure that raters are not awarding high scores for sentence-level clarity alone, at the expense of sentence-level coherence.
 
 3. Emphasize the importance of logical transitions between sentences in the coherence definition to avoid inconsistent scoring across samples.
 
 4. Remove the language about "hard to follow" in the coherence definition, as this may lead to raters awarding low scores for disconnected sentences rather than those with poor logical flow.
 
 5. Revise the fluency instruction to make explicit that sentences should be grammatically correct, to avoid penalizing summaries with minor grammatical errors.
 
 6. Emphasize the importance of supporting details in the relevance definition to ensure raters are awarding high scores for summaries that include context and supporting information.

Clarify the relevance instruction to differentiate between capturing "key points, context, and supporting details" versus capturing "most but not all" aspects, as the current instruction's strict definitions (e.g., awarding 1 point for including irrelevant information) may lead to lower accuracy and f1 scores.
3. Review the consistency instruction to ensure that it accurately reflects the required fact-checking and contradiction assessment, as the observed CE of 1.904 and f1 of 0.138 suggest some misalignment with expert annotators' expectations.
4. Reconsider the metric definitions and instruction language to minimize the observed biases in favor of higher scores for coherence (CE of 1.774) and fluency (CE of 1.794) compared to relevance and consistency.



--- Top 7 Prompt ---
Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency, and consistency, considering the following criteria:

For coherence, evaluate the logical flow between sentences, the overall quality of sentence structure, and whether sentences are well-organized and clearly connected, regardless of whether transitions are explicitly stated. Award 4 or 5 points if sentences are well-organized and clearly connected, 3 points if they are somewhat connected but not logically, 2 points if they are disconnected or lacking transitions, and 1 point if they are hard to follow.

For relevance, consider not only key points but also context and supporting details. Ensure that all and only the important aspects are captured, and facts are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article. Award 4 or 5 points if the summary captures key points and context, and includes supporting details that are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article, 3 points if it captures most but not all, 2 points if it captures some but not all, and 1 point if it misses key points or includes irrelevant information.

For fluency, assess the quality of individual sentences, including grammar, sentence-level clarity, and overall coherence. Separate the evaluation of sentence-level clarity and overall coherence. Award 4 or 5 points if sentences are well-written, clear, and grammatically correct, 3 points if they are somewhat clear but lack polish, 2 points if they are unclear or grammatically incorrect, and 1 point if they are hard to understand.

For consistency, evaluate the accuracy of facts and whether they are consistently supported by evidence from the original article. Award 4 or 5 points if facts are accurately reproduced and consistently supported, 3 points if they are mostly accurate but occasionally contradicted, 2 points if they are partially accurate but often contradicted, and 1 point if they are frequently or completely contradicted.

Compare the summary to the full article to evaluate relevance, and ensure that facts are accurately reproduced and not contradicted. State the source of information when citing the original article to support consistency. Evaluate the summary in the context of the original article's purpose and scope to improve relevance.

Award high scores for relevance if the summary captures key points, context, and supporting details that are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article. Award high scores for consistency if facts are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article. Award high scores for fluency if sentences are well-written, clear, and grammatically correct. Award high scores for coherence if sentences are well-organized and clearly connected, regardless of whether transitions are explicitly stated.

Award 4 or 5 points for coherence if sentences are well-organized and clearly connected, 3 points if they are somewhat connected but not logically, 2 points if they are disconnected or lacking transitions, and 1 point if they are hard to follow. Award 4 or 5 points for fluency if sentences are well-written, clear, and grammatically correct, 3 points if they are somewhat clear but lack polish, 2 points if they are unclear or grammatically incorrect, and 1 point if they are hard to understand.

Award 4 or 5 points for consistency if facts are accurately reproduced and consistently supported, 3 points if they are mostly accurate but occasionally contradicted, 2 points if they are partially accurate but often contradicted, and 1 point if they are frequently or completely contradicted. Award 4 or 5 points for relevance if the summary captures key points, context, and supporting details that are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article, 3 points if it captures most but not all, 2 points if it captures some but not all, and 1 point if it misses key points or includes irrelevant information.

When evaluating fluency, consider evaluating sentence-level clarity and coherence separately.

Recommendations:

1. Revise the fluency instruction to make a clear distinction between sentence-level clarity and coherence, and provide specific examples to illustrate the difference. The current instruction "For fluency, assess the quality of individual sentences, including grammar, sentence-level clarity, and overall coherence" may be causing confusion, resulting in the low accuracy (0.22) and F1 score (0.154) for fluency.

2. Re-evaluate the coherence metric definition to place more emphasis on explicit transitions between sentences, as the current instruction "Award 4 or 5 points if sentences are well-organized and clearly connected, regardless of whether transitions are explicitly stated" may be leading to inconsistent ratings, evident from the low accuracy (0.24) and F1 score (0.163) for coherence.

3. Consider revising the consistency instruction to specify that the evaluation of consistency should focus on factual accuracy rather than overall coherence, as the current instruction "Evaluate the summary in the context of the original article's purpose and scope to improve relevance" may be causing the model to conflate relevance and consistency. The accuracy (0.15), F1 score (0.149), and Cross-Entropy loss (1.894) for consistency suggest this potential issue.

4. Provide more guidance on how to award scores for relevance, particularly for the 4 or 5-point category, as the current instruction "Award 4 or 5 points if the summary captures key points, context, and supporting details that are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article" may be too vague, leading to inconsistent ratings. The accuracy (0.26), F1 score (0.228), and Cross-Entropy loss (1.784) for relevance suggest that refinement of this metric is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize 'logical transitions between sentences', as the current definition focuses heavily on sentence organization, which may not fully capture the nuance of coherence.
2. Clarify the definition of fluency to better separate the evaluation of sentence-level clarity and overall coherence, as the current instruction may be leading to inconsistencies in evaluation.
3. Revise the consistency instruction to specify that 'facts are frequently or completely contradicted' should result in a score of 1, as the current instruction may allow for partial credit.
4. Strengthen the relevance instruction to emphasize the importance of 'capturing key points, context, and supporting details that are accurately reproduced and consistently supported by evidence from the original article', to better align with the high accuracy of relevance observed.
5. Implement a revised scoring system for fluency, coherence, and consistency, such as a weighted average of sentence-level clarity and overall coherence, to better capture the complexity of these metrics.
6. Provide concrete examples or case studies to illustrate the application of the instruction, to help reduce ambiguity and increase inter-rater agreement.
7. Emphasize the importance of consistency in evaluating fluency, coherence, and relevance, by explicitly stating that these metrics should be evaluated in the context of the original article's purpose and scope.
