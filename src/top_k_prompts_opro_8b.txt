Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency, and consistency, considering whether the summary accurately reproduces the key points of the article, sounds natural and well-structured, and is free of grammatical errors.

Metrics:
   fluency:
       accuracy: 0.111
       f1: 0.167
   coherence:
       accuracy: 0.111

       f1: 0.111

Recommendations:
  1. Revise the fluency instruction to emphasize evaluating grammatical correctness in addition to "sounds natural".
  2. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize "logical transitions between sentences" in addition to "sounds natural and well-structured".
  3. Clarify the consistency instruction to specifically mention evaluating whether the summary "reproduces all facts accurately and does not make up untrue information".
  4. Consider revising the relevance instruction to provide examples of "key points" that should be captured in the summary to help the rater better understand the concept.
