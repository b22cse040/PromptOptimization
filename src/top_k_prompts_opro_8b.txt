Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its fluency, coherence, and overall quality, considering the clarity and natural flow of individual sentences and the collective cohesion of the summary as a whole.

Metrics:
   fluency:
       accuracy: 0.312
       f1: 0.385
       CE_fluency: 1.731
   coherence:
       accuracy: 0.25
       f1: 0.119
       CE_coherence: 1.794

Recommendations:
1. The LLM is being lenient in its judgement, as indicated by the positive mean_diff scores across all examples. To address this, we recommend increasing the ratings for fluency and coherence to reflect a more stringent evaluation.
2. The instruction could be revised to provide more clarity on what constitutes "natural flow of individual sentences" and "collective cohesion of the summary as a whole." This could include examples or specific criteria to help the LLM understand what to look for in each metric.
3. The LLM appears to be struggling with capturing key points and important aspects of the article, as seen in examples 4 and 5, where the machine summaries lack essential information. To address this, we recommend revising the coherence instruction to emphasize the importance of capturing key points and ensuring that all important aspects are covered in the summary.
4. The LLM seems to be inconsistent in its evaluation of fluency, as seen in examples 7 and 9, where the machine summaries are quite different in terms of grammatical correctness and sentence structure. To address this, we recommend revising the fluency instruction to provide more specific guidance on what constitutes good sentence structure and grammar.
5. The LLM appears to be biased towards shorter summaries, as seen in examples 1 and 2, where the machine summaries are significantly shorter than the original text. To address this, we recommend revising the instruction to encourage the LLM to produce more comprehensive summaries that cover all key points and important aspects of the article.
