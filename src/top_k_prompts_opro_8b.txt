2. Emphasize the importance of logical sentence transitions in coherence evaluation by providing a specific guideline for evaluating the quality of sentence connections and transitions.
3. Clarify the tone and style consistency guideline to ensure that raters evaluate summaries based on a consistent tone and style throughout the summary, similar to the original article.
4. Prioritize the evaluation of accuracy over the introduction of new information by providing a clear definition of what constitutes "new insights or perspectives" and how they should be evaluated in the summary.
5. Focus on the most critical information points (2) to be captured in the summary, with a clear definition of what constitutes "critical information points" and "key details explicitly stated in the article", to ensure that sentences flow smoothly and logically to maintain a cohesive text.
6. Provide a clear guideline for evaluating the quality of individual sentences in terms of fluency, and a specific definition of what constitutes a "well-written and grammatically correct text" to ensure consistent evaluation.
7. Emphasize the importance of logical sentence transitions in coherence evaluation, and clarifying the tone and style consistency guideline, and providing a specific definition of a "well-written and grammatically correct text" to improve overall performance.
8. Revise the instruction to prioritize the evaluation of accuracy over the introduction of new information, and focusing on the most critical information points (2) to be captured in the summary, with a clear definition of what constitutes "critical information points" and "key details explicitly stated in the article", to ensure that sentences flow smoothly and logically to maintain a cohesive text.

Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency, and consistency, considering whether the summary accurately reproduces all facts, captures the 2 most critical information points explicitly stated in the article, presents a well-written and grammatically correct text with logical sentence transitions, maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, effectively conveys the main idea or thesis of the article, and provides new insights or perspectives where applicable, with a clear definition of key details, key points, and new insights or perspectives, and a specific guideline for evaluating tone and style consistency, logical sentence transitions, and cohesive and well-structured text, prioritizing the evaluation of accuracy over the introduction of new information, and focusing on the most critical information points (2) to be captured in the summary, with a clear definition of what constitutes "critical information points" and "key details explicitly stated in the article", ensuring that sentences flow smoothly and logically to maintain a cohesive text, and maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout the summary, similar to the original article, with a clear guideline for evaluating the quality of individual sentences in terms of fluency, and a specific definition of what constitutes a "well-written and grammatically correct text".

Recommendations:
1. Revise the instruction to provide a clear definition of "well-written and grammatically correct text" for fluency evaluation, as the current definition may be too vague and lead to inconsistent ratings.
2. Clarify the instruction to specify that "key details explicitly stated in the article" should be explicitly defined and listed, to avoid ambiguity and ensure consistency in relevance ratings.
3. Emphasize the importance of logical sentence transitions in coherence evaluation, as the current instruction only mentions "smooth and logical flow" without providing a clear guideline for evaluating this aspect.
4. Revise the instruction to provide a clear guideline for evaluating tone and style consistency, as the current instruction only mentions maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout the summary, without specifying how to evaluate this aspect.
5. Consider adding a specific definition of "critical information points" to ensure that raters are evaluating the same aspects of the article, and to provide a clear guideline for evaluating relevance.
6. Revise the instruction to prioritize the evaluation of accuracy over the introduction of new information, as the current instruction may lead to raters focusing too much on new insights and perspectives, rather than ensuring the accuracy of the summary.
7. Consider adding a specific guideline for evaluating the quality of individual sentences in terms of fluency, as the current instruction only mentions "well-written and grammatically correct text" without providing a clear definition or evaluation criteria.
