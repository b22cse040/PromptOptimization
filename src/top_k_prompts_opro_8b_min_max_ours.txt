Recommendations: 
  1. Decrease the threshold for fluency to better capture the nuances of machine-generated summaries, as the current threshold may be too strict, resulting in a high Cross-Entropy Loss of 1.944. Consider revising the fluency metric to focus on more significant errors or clarity issues, rather than penalizing minor errors.
  2. Refine the coherence instruction to emphasize capturing key points of the article and whether all the important aspects are covered, as the current instruction may be too vague. Provide specific examples or guidelines on what constitutes a coherent summary, such as including all relevant information and excluding unnecessary details.
  3. Revise the consistency metric definition to focus on factual accuracy and penalize significant factual inaccuracies, as the current definition may be too broad. Add more specific guidelines on how to identify and evaluate factual accuracy, such as verifying facts through external sources and avoiding assumptions.
  4. Emphasize the importance of excluding any unnecessary information in the relevance metric, as the current instruction may not be clear enough. Provide specific guidelines on what constitutes relevant information and how to distinguish it from unnecessary details.
  5. Consider revising the instruction to provide clearer guidelines on what constitutes a coherent, consistent, and relevant summary, as the current instruction may be too vague.
