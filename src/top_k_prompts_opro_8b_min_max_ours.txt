Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its fluency, coherence, consistency, and relevance, considering the quality of individual sentences, the overall natural flow, accuracy of facts, and inclusion of key points, respectively, with the goal of minimizing CE_fluency, CE_coherence, CE_consistency, and CE_relevance.

Metrics:
   fluency:
       accuracy: 0.625
       f1: 0.663
       CE_fluency: 1.419
   coherence:

   relevance:
       accuracy: 0.381
       f1: 0.253
       CE_relevance: 1.662

Recommendations:
  1. Adjust the scoring to be less lenient on fluency, as the LLM tends to give high scores (e.g., Example 2 has a fluency score of 2, which is relatively high considering the summary is not entirely fluent). Consider decreasing the threshold for fluency scores to better reflect the quality of individual sentences.
  2. Refine the coherence instruction to emphasize the importance of capturing key points and including all relevant information in the summary. The current instruction may be too broad, leading to inconsistent scoring (e.g., Example 3 has a coherence score of 4, which is high, while Example 1 has a coherence score of -1, which is low). Consider adding specific examples or guidelines to clarify what constitutes a coherent summary.
  3. Identify and address the systematic bias in scoring consistency. The LLM tends to be harsh on consistency scores, particularly when the summary is not entirely accurate (e.g., Example 1 has a consistency score of -1, while Example 5 has a consistency score of 3). Consider increasing the threshold for consistency scores to better reflect the quality of the summary's factual accuracy.
  4. Revise the relevance instruction to provide clearer guidelines on what constitutes a relevant summary. The current instruction may be too vague, leading to inconsistent scoring (e.g., Example 2 has a relevance score of 1, while Example 5 has a relevance score of 2). Consider adding specific examples or guidelines to clarify what makes a summary relevant to the original article.

   relevance:
       accuracy: 0.331
       f1: 0.221
       CE_relevance: 1.712

Recommendations: 
  1. Adjust the fluency metric to be less strict, as the LLM is penalizing grammatical errors and unclear sentence structures too harshly, resulting in high CE_fluency loss. Consider revising the instruction to focus on clarity and coherence rather than strict grammatical correctness.
  2. Refine the coherence instruction to emphasize capturing key points of the article and whether all the important aspects are covered, as the current instruction may be causing confusion. This could help reduce the high CE_coherence loss.
  3. Increase the threshold for accurate factual reproduction in the consistency metric, as the LLM is being too lenient in its judgments, resulting in high CE_consistency loss. Consider revising the instruction to require more precise and accurate factual reproduction.
  4. Provide clearer guidelines on what constitutes a relevant summary in the relevance metric, as the current instruction may be causing confusion. This could help reduce the high CE_relevance loss and improve the overall accuracy of the LLM's judgments.

       CE_relevance: 1.681

Recommendations:
1. Adjust the instruction to emphasize the importance of capturing key points in the coherence metric, as the current instruction may be too broad. This could be achieved by adding a phrase such as "and whether all the important aspects are covered" to the coherence instruction.
2. Refine the consistency metric definition to clarify that it measures the accuracy of facts in the summary, rather than the overall consistency of the summary. This could be achieved by rephrasing the instruction to focus on "the accuracy of facts in the summary" rather than "the overall natural flow".
3. Consider revising the relevance metric definition to emphasize the importance of including all and only the important aspects, as the current instruction may be too vague. This could be achieved by adding a phrase such as "and excluding any unnecessary information" to the relevance instruction.
4. Review the task-wise differences for each example to identify any systematic biases or recurring mistakes in scoring. For example, the machine summary for Example 4 has a high coherence score despite missing key information, suggesting that the model may be too lenient in its coherence scoring.
