Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency, and consistency of sentences, considering how well it captures the key points, reproduces facts accurately, sounds naturally, and is well-written and grammatically correct.

Metrics:
   fluency:
       accuracy: 0.2
       f1: 0.079
   coherence:
       accuracy: 0.0
       f1: 0.0
   consistency:
       accuracy: 0.1
       f1: 0.08
   relevance:
       accuracy: 0.0
       f1: 0.0

Recommendations:
  1. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize 'logical transitions between sentences' and provide examples of coherent and incoherent summaries to clarify the metric.
  2. Emphasize the importance of accuracy in consistency rating by revising the instruction to highlight the difference between reproducing facts accurately and making up untrue information.
  3. Clarify the fluency instruction by adding examples of well-written and grammatically correct sentences to help the model better understand the quality of individual sentences.
  4. Rephrase the relevance instruction to focus on the summary capturing 'all and only the important aspects' of the article, and provide examples of relevant and irrelevant summaries.
  5. Provide additional guidance on how to rate summaries with multiple errors, as the current instruction may be too broad, leading to low accuracy and f1 scores across all metrics.
