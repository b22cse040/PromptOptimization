Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency, and consistency of sentences, ensuring it accurately captures key points, reproduces facts truthfully, and sounds natural and well-written.

Metrics:
   fluency:
       accuracy: 0.0
       f1: 0.0
       CE_fluency: 2.044
   coherence:
       accuracy: 0.0
       f1: 0.0
       CE_coherence: 2.044
   consistency:
       accuracy: 0.2
       f1: 0.114
       CE_consistency: 1.844
   relevance:
       accuracy: 0.0
       f1: 0.0
       CE_relevance: 2.044

Recommendations:
  1. Revise the instruction to explicitly define and separate the concepts of fluency and coherence, emphasizing that fluency assesses individual sentence quality and coherence evaluates the logical flow of the entire summary.
  2. Emphasize the importance of relevance in the instruction, providing examples of how to accurately capture key points from the article, as the current results indicate a complete misalignment (0.0 accuracy and f1-score).
  3. Refine the consistency instruction to focus on factual accuracy, providing examples of how to identify and penalize summaries that introduce untrue information or contradict the original article.
  4. Consider adding guiding principles or examples to illustrate the differences between scores 1-5 for each metric, as the current results suggest a lack of nuance in the ratings.
