For consistency, verify the accuracy of specific details, numbers, and dates mentioned in the summary against the original article, prioritizing accuracy and ensuring that the summary does not introduce untrue information, with explicit guidance on evaluating the summary as a whole for consistency and fact-based evaluation, and emphasizing the importance of verifying specific details in the context of the entire summary, with explicit examples of what constitutes accurate and inaccurate details, numbers, and dates, and a clear definition of "untrue information" that includes specific examples of inaccurate details, numbers, and dates. For fluency, assess the sentence-level clarity, checking for well-structured sentences, proper punctuation, and a consistent tone and style that aligns with the article, prioritizing clarity over minor grammatical errors, distinguishing between minor errors and significant fluency issues, and emphasizing the importance of sentence-level clarity and grammatical correctness in relation to the overall tone and style of the article, with clear guidance on distinguishing between minor and significant fluency issues, and examples of minor vs. significant grammatical errors. For relevance, determine whether the summary captures the key points of the article, avoiding non-essential information, and evaluate the summary as a whole, considering the context of the article, weighing key points against non-essential information, and demonstrating contextual understanding, with clear guidance on distinguishing between key points and non-essential information, prioritizing contextual understanding and accuracy, and providing explicit examples to illustrate the distinction, and specific examples of how to weigh key points against non-essential information in the context of the article. Provide a rating that reflects your overall assessment of the summary's quality, considering each metric independently before providing an overall assessment, evaluating the summary as a whole for each metric, and encouraging a holistic evaluation of summaries that balances individual metric assessments with an overall rating, and considering the interplay between metrics to improve overall rating accuracy and reduce inconsistencies, with explicit guidance on the interplay between metrics and additional examples of holistic evaluations that consider both individual metric assessments and overall rating accuracy.

Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency, and consistency of sentences, ensuring it accurately captures key points, reproduces facts correctly, and sounds natural and well-written. When evaluating coherence, prioritize the summary's paragraph-level logical flow and naturalness, assessing whether the ideas are clearly connected and the summary flows smoothly, with a focus on evaluating clear topic sentences and logical transitions within paragraphs, and considering the summary as a whole, including sentence-to-sentence connections, with explicit examples to illustrate the distinction between a well-connected summary and a poorly connected one. For consistency, verify the accuracy of specific details, numbers, and dates mentioned in the summary against the original article, prioritizing accuracy and ensuring that the summary does not introduce untrue information, with explicit guidance on evaluating the summary as a whole for consistency and fact-based evaluation, and emphasizing the importance of verifying specific details in the context of the entire summary, with explicit examples of what constitutes accurate and inaccurate details, numbers, and dates, and a clear definition of "untrue information" that includes specific examples of inaccurate details, numbers, and dates. For fluency, assess the sentence-level clarity, checking for well-structured sentences, proper punctuation, and a consistent tone and style that aligns with the article, prioritizing clarity over minor grammatical errors, distinguishing between minor errors and significant fluency issues, and emphasizing the importance of sentence-level clarity and grammatical correctness in relation to the overall tone and style of the article, with clear guidance on distinguishing between minor and significant fluency issues, and examples of minor vs. significant grammatical errors. For relevance, determine whether the summary captures the key points of the article, avoiding non-essential information, and evaluate the summary as a whole, considering the context of the article, weighing key points against non-essential information, and demonstrating contextual understanding, with clear guidance on distinguishing between key points and non-essential information, prioritizing contextual understanding and accuracy, and providing explicit examples to illustrate the distinction, and specific examples of how to weigh key points against non-essential information in the context of the article. Provide a rating that reflects your overall assessment of the summary's quality, considering each metric independently before providing an overall assessment, evaluating the summary as a whole for each metric, and encouraging a holistic evaluation of summaries that balances individual metric assessments with an overall rating, and considering the interplay between metrics to improve overall rating accuracy and reduce inconsistencies, with explicit guidance on the interplay between metrics and additional examples of holistic evaluations that consider both individual metric assessments and overall rating accuracy.

Recommendations:
  1. Revise the coherence instruction to focus on sentence-to-sentence connections and logical transitions, and remove the emphasis on paragraph-level logical flow, as the current instruction may be causing the model to underrate coherence (accuracy of coherence: 0.19, f1 of coherence: 0.181).
  2. Emphasize the importance of contextual understanding in the relevance instruction, providing more examples of how to weigh key points against non-essential information in the context of the article, as the model may be struggling to capture key points (accuracy of relevance: 0.28, f1 of relevance: 0.213).
  3. Refine the fluency instruction to prioritize sentence-level clarity and grammatical correctness, and provide more guidance on distinguishing between minor and significant fluency issues, as the model's performance on fluency is poor (accuracy of fluency: 0.29, f1 of fluency: 0.23).
  4. Add explicit examples to the consistency instruction to illustrate the distinction between accurate and inaccurate details, numbers, and dates, and provide clear guidance on evaluating the summary as a whole for consistency and fact-based evaluation, as the model's performance on consistency is mediocre (accuracy of consistency: 0.32, f1 of consistency: 0.279).
