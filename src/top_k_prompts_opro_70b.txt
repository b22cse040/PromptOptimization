  3. Strengthen the instruction on consistency by providing more specific examples of accurate and inaccurate reproduction of factual information, potentially including examples of subtle inconsistencies or inaccuracies that the model may be missing.
  4. Refine the fluency instruction to place more emphasis on sentence-level clarity and precision, as the current instruction's focus on grammatical correctness may not be sufficient to capture the nuances of well-written sentences.
  5. Emphasize the importance of evaluating each metric independently in the instruction, potentially by providing examples of summaries that excel in one metric but struggle in another, to help the model avoid biases and ensure accurate assessments of summary quality.
