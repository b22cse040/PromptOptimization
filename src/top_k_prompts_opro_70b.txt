Recommendations:
  1. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize 'logical transitions between sentences' and provide stricter guidelines for evaluating coherence, as the current ratings suggest leniency in this metric.
  2. Clarify the definition of fluency to include specific criteria for grammatical correctness, concision, and clarity, as the low accuracy and f1 scores indicate a need for more precise guidelines.
  3. Address the observed bias in the relevance metric by providing more detailed guidelines for evaluating the summary's ability to capture the main points of the article, including the most important information and key takeaways.
  4. Emphasize the importance of consistency in the evaluation process, as the high mean_diff scores suggest that the rater is being lenient in their judgments.
  5. Provide additional training or guidance to the rater on evaluating summaries with high levels of Cross-Entropy Loss, as the points with the most errors suggest a need for improved evaluation skills in these cases.

Ensure that the summary accurately represents the article's main points, and penalize any omissions or inaccuracies. A relevant summary should cover all crucial information, without including unnecessary details. Be strict in your evaluation, and consider the following guidelines: a score of 5 indicates that the summary captures all key points, including the central argument, main findings, and key implications; a score of 4 indicates that the summary captures most key points, but misses some important details; a score of 3 indicates that the summary captures some key points, but misses important information; a score of 2 indicates that the summary captures few key points; and a score of 1 indicates that the summary fails to capture any key points. When evaluating relevance, consider the summary's ability to capture the main points of the article, including the most important information and key takeaways. Ensure that the summary accurately conveys the article's central argument, main findings, and key implications, and penalize any summaries that fail to capture these essential elements. Consider the following specific guidelines: a score of 5 indicates that the summary captures all key points, including the central argument, main findings, and key implications; a score of 4 indicates that the summary captures most key points, but misses some important details; a score of 3 indicates that the summary captures some key points, but misses important information; a score of 2 indicates that the summary captures few key points; and a score of 1 indicates that the summary fails to capture any key points.

- Consistency: Assess whether the facts in the summary are consistent with the facts in the original article, penalizing any inaccuracies or untrue information. Ensure that the summary reproduces all facts accurately, and verify that the information is presented in a truthful and unbiased manner. Be strict in your evaluation, and consider the following guidelines: a score of 5 indicates that the summary is entirely consistent with the article, with no inaccuracies or untrue information; a score of 4 indicates that the summary is mostly consistent, but contains some minor inaccuracies; a score of 3 indicates that the summary contains some inaccuracies; a score of 2 indicates that the summary contains significant inaccuracies; and a score of 1 indicates that the summary contains entirely false information. When evaluating consistency, penalize minor inaccuracies and ensure that the summary presents information in a truthful and unbiased manner. Verify that the summary accurately represents the article's facts, figures, and data, and penalize any summaries that contain untrue information or inaccuracies. Consider the following specific guidelines: a score of 5 indicates that the summary is entirely consistent with the article, with no inaccuracies or untrue information; a score of 4 indicates that the summary is mostly consistent, but contains some minor inaccuracies; a score of 3 indicates that the summary contains some inaccuracies; a score of 2 indicates that the summary contains significant inaccuracies; and a score of 1 indicates that the summary contains entirely false information.

- Coherence: Evaluate the logical transitions between sentences, considering whether the summary sounds natural and cohesive as a whole. Focus on the overall flow of the summary, and assess whether the sentences are well-connected and easy to follow. A coherent summary should have a clear structure and logical progression. Be strict in your evaluation, and consider the following guidelines: a score of 5 indicates that the summary is entirely coherent, with a clear structure and logical progression; a score of 4 indicates that the summary is mostly coherent, but contains some minor disruptions; a score of 3 indicates that the summary contains some disruptions; a score of 2 indicates that the summary contains significant disruptions; and a score of 1 indicates that the summary is entirely incoherent. When evaluating coherence, consider the summary as a whole, rather than individual sentences, and emphasize logical transitions between sentences. Ensure that the summary has a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, and that the sentences are logically connected, with a clear and concise writing style. Consider the following specific guidelines: a score of 5 indicates that the summary is entirely coherent, with a clear structure and logical progression; a score of 4 indicates that the summary is mostly coherent, but contains some minor disruptions; a score of 3 indicates that the summary contains some disruptions; a score of 2 indicates that the summary contains significant disruptions; and a score of 1 indicates that the summary is entirely incoherent.

- Fluency: Evaluate the quality of individual sentences, considering whether they are well-written, grammatically correct, and concise. Be strict in your evaluation, penalizing any poorly written or grammatically incorrect sentences. Ensure that the sentences are clear, concise, and free of errors. Consider the following guidelines: a score of 5 indicates that the sentences are entirely fluent, with no grammatical errors, punctuation errors, or spelling mistakes; a score of 4 indicates that the sentences are mostly fluent, but contain some minor errors; a score of 3 indicates that the sentences contain some errors; a score of 2 indicates that the sentences contain significant errors; and a score of 1 indicates that the sentences are entirely unfluent. When evaluating fluency, consider clear criteria for grammatical correctness, concision, and clarity, and penalize poorly written or grammatically incorrect sentences. Ensure that the sentences are free of grammatical errors, punctuation errors, and spelling mistakes, and that they are concise and easy to understand. Consider the following specific guidelines: a score of 5 indicates that the sentences are entirely fluent, with no grammatical errors, punctuation errors, or spelling mistakes; a score of 4 indicates that the sentences are mostly fluent, but contain some minor errors; a score of 3 indicates that the sentences contain some errors; a score of 2 indicates that the sentences contain significant errors; and a score of 1 indicates that the sentences are entirely unfluent.

When evaluating the overall quality of the summary, consider the importance of each aspect and provide a rating that reflects the summary's performance across all metrics. Ensure that your ratings are accurate and consistent, avoiding leniency or harshness, and provide clear and concise feedback that justifies your ratings.

Recommendations:
  1. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize 'logical transitions between sentences' and provide stricter rating guidelines to address the observed leniency in coherence ratings.
  2. Clarify the fluency definition to focus on grammatical correctness, concision, and clarity, and provide specific examples of well-written and poorly written sentences to guide the rater.
  3. Address the observed bias in relevance ratings by providing additional guidance on evaluating the summary's ability to capture the main points of the article, including the most important information and key takeaways.
  4. Emphasize the importance of consistency in evaluating the facts in the summary, and provide stricter rating guidelines to address the observed leniency in consistency ratings.
  5. Revise the instruction to provide more specific guidelines for evaluating the overall quality of the summary, including the importance of each aspect and how to provide a rating that reflects the summary's performance across all metrics.
