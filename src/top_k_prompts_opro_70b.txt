Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its global coherence, evaluating the summary as a whole to assess how well its sentences form a unified and logically connected narrative that effectively conveys the article's key information and main ideas, with emphasis on the summary's ability to convey key information and main ideas, considering the article's content and main points, and using guiding principles such as evaluating the logical flow and connections between sentences, while focusing on the most critical aspects of coherence that contribute to the overall narrative structure, and providing a comprehensive evaluation of the summary's coherence by considering both the collective quality of sentences and the overall narrative structure, with specific examples of what constitutes a "unified and logically connected narrative" to reduce ambiguity and improve model alignment with expert annotators, and ensuring that the summary presents a clear and logical narrative that effectively conveys the article's key information and main ideas, with clear guidance on how to distinguish between global and local coherence aspects, and evaluating the summary's coherence in relation to the article's content and main points, prioritizing the evaluation of the summary's ability to convey key information and main ideas over its linguistic features, and providing concrete examples of what constitutes a coherent summary.

Metrics:
   coherence:
       accuracy: 0.325
       f1: 0.246
       CE_coherence: 1.719

Recommendations:
  1. Revise the coherence instruction to focus on evaluating the summary's ability to convey key information and main ideas, rather than emphasizing the logical flow and connections between sentences, as the current instruction may lead to overemphasis on sentence-level coherence.
  2. Clarify the definition of "unified and logically connected narrative" by providing more specific examples of what constitutes a coherent summary, as the current instruction may be too vague, leading to inconsistent ratings.
  3. Emphasize the importance of prioritizing the evaluation of the summary's ability to convey key information and main ideas over its linguistic features, as the current instruction may lead to bias towards summaries with better linguistic quality but lower coherence.

       CE_coherence: 1.719

Recommendations:
  1. Revise the coherence instruction to focus more on the logical flow and connections between sentences, rather than emphasizing the summary's ability to convey key information and main ideas, as the current emphasis may lead to overemphasizing content coverage over narrative structure.
  2. Clarify the distinction between global and local coherence aspects by providing more specific examples and guiding principles, as the current instruction may cause confusion in evaluating the summary's coherence in relation to the article's content and main points.
  3. Minimize the emphasis on providing concrete examples of what constitutes a coherent summary, as this may lead to overfitting to specific examples rather than evaluating the summary's coherence more broadly, and instead focus on providing clear guidance on how to evaluate the summary's coherence in relation to the article's content and main points.
