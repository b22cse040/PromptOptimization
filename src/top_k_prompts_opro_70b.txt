Instruction:
Evaluate the summary of the news article based on four key aspects: fluency, coherence, consistency, and relevance. Assign a score from 1 to 5 for each aspect, considering the following:

fluency - how clear are the individual sentences, with a focus on sentence-level clarity, avoiding ambiguity, ensuring subject-verb agreement, and prioritizing ease of understanding, while also considering the use of active voice and proper sentence structure, and emphasizing clarity over concision;

coherence - how logically the sentences transition into each other, forming a cohesive narrative, emphasizing logical connections between sentences, ensuring a smooth flow of ideas, and prioritizing logical connections over overall structure, while maintaining a clear distinction from consistency;

consistency - how accurately the summary reproduces the facts from the original article, avoiding untrue, contradictory, or unverifiable information, ensuring that all facts are presented in a way that is faithful to the original article, explicitly fact-checking and verifying information, prioritizing accuracy and reliability, maintaining consistency in tone and style, and evaluating the use of proper nouns, dates, and statistics, including reasonable inferences and implied facts;

and relevance - how well the summary captures the key points of the article, including only the most important and essential aspects that convey the main idea, excluding unnecessary details, providing specific examples of what constitutes "key points" and "essential aspects," such as main events, key quotes, critical information, supporting evidence, background information, and relevant examples, anecdotes, and data to support the main idea, and prioritizing the most critical information while maintaining a clear and concise narrative.

When evaluating, balance the prioritization of coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance, considering the interplay between these aspects, and address potential biases by consistently evaluating each aspect based on its unique definition, especially for summaries that excel in one or more aspects but may falter in others, and provide a nuanced assessment that reflects the strengths and weaknesses of the summary.

Recommendations:
  1. Revise the fluency instruction to explicitly emphasize the importance of grammatical correctness and proper sentence structure, as the current performance suggests a lack of clarity on these aspects, with a low accuracy of 0.21 and high Cross-Entropy Loss of 1.834.
  2. Emphasize the distinction between coherence and consistency in the instruction, as the similar performance metrics for both (accuracy: 0.26, f1: 0.183, CE: 1.784) suggest potential confusion between the two aspects.
  3. Provide more specific examples of what constitutes "key points" and "essential aspects" in the relevance instruction, as the moderate performance (accuracy: 0.26, f1: 0.183) suggests room for improvement in identifying the most important information.
  4. Add guiding principles to address potential biases when evaluating summaries that excel in one or more aspects but falter in others, as the instruction currently emphasizes balancing prioritization, but the performance metrics suggest inconsistencies in evaluation.
  5. Consider revising the consistency instruction to prioritize fact-checking and verification, as the moderate performance (accuracy: 0.23, f1: 0.224) suggests room for improvement in ensuring accuracy and reliability.

fluency - how clear and grammatically correct are the individual sentences, with a focus on sentence-level clarity and grammatical correctness, ensuring subject-verb agreement, and prioritizing proper sentence structure, while also considering the use of active voice and proper sentence structure, and providing specific examples of clear and unclear sentences to reduce ambiguity;

coherence - how logically the sentences transition into each other, forming a cohesive narrative, emphasizing overall narrative flow, ensuring a smooth flow of ideas, and prioritizing logical connections over overall structure, while maintaining a clear distinction from consistency, and providing specific examples of cohesive narrative structures, such as the use of transition phrases and cohesive devices, and evaluating sentence transitions in context;

consistency - how accurately the summary reproduces the facts from the original article, avoiding untrue, contradictory, or unverifiable information, ensuring that all facts are presented in a way that is faithful to the original article, explicitly fact-checking and verifying information, prioritizing factual accuracy and reliability over tone and style consistency, and evaluating the use of proper nouns, dates, and statistics, including reasonable inferences and implied facts;

and relevance - how well the summary captures the key points of the article, including only the most important and essential aspects that convey the main idea, excluding unnecessary details, providing specific examples of what constitutes "key points" and "essential aspects," such as main events, key quotes, critical information, supporting evidence, background information, and relevant examples, anecdotes, and data to support the main idea, and prioritizing the most critical information while maintaining a clear and concise narrative, with a balance between relevance and concision.

When evaluating, balance the prioritization of coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance, considering the interplay between these aspects, and address potential biases by consistently evaluating each aspect based on its unique definition, especially for summaries that excel in one or more aspects but may falter in others, and provide a nuanced assessment that reflects the strengths and weaknesses of the summary.

Recommendations:
  
1. Revise the fluency instruction to emphasize "overall sentence quality" rather than focusing solely on sentence-level clarity and grammatical correctness, providing specific examples of high-quality sentences that balance clarity, concision, and style.

2. Clarify the distinction between consistency and coherence by providing explicit examples of how to evaluate factual accuracy (consistency) versus logical transitions and narrative flow (coherence).

3. Emphasize the importance of balancing relevance and concision in the relevance instruction, providing examples of how to prioritize critical information while maintaining a clear and concise narrative.

4. Consider rephrasing the coherence instruction to focus on "narrative cohesion" rather than "logical transitions," highlighting the importance of evaluating sentence connections in context to form a cohesive narrative.

5. Provide additional guidance on addressing biases when evaluating summaries that excel in one or more aspects but may falter in others, emphasizing the need for nuanced assessments that reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the summary.
