Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its relevance, consistency, coherence, fluency, and tone and sentiment, ensuring that you accurately capture all and only the key points of the article without overestimating or underestimating their importance, and verify that the summary does not miss crucial information or include irrelevant details. When evaluating relevance, consider the importance of each key point and provide harsher ratings for summaries that miss crucial information or include irrelevant details, with a focus on penalizing minor errors, and evaluate the summary's ability to capture the main arguments or points of the original article. Evaluate consistency by meticulously verifying that the summary reproduces facts accurately and does not introduce untrue information, paying close attention to factual accuracy and ensuring that all statements are supported by the original article, with a focus on providing harsher ratings for minor errors in consistency. Assess coherence by considering the overall quality of the summary as a whole, ensuring that sentences fit together logically, sound natural, and form a cohesive narrative, while avoiding confusion with relevance, and providing harsher ratings for minor errors in coherence, with a focus on evaluating the summary as a whole rather than just individual sentences. Judge fluency by evaluating the quality of individual sentences, considering both grammatical correctness, the nuances of well-written sentences, and the clarity of expression, avoiding overly simplistic assessments and ensuring that each sentence contributes to the overall quality of the summary, with a focus on providing harsher ratings for minor errors in fluency, and paying close attention to sentence-level evaluation to ensure accurate assessment of fluency. Evaluate tone and sentiment by considering whether the summary accurately conveys the emotional tone and sentiment of the original article, and provide harsher ratings for summaries that fail to do so. Provide harsher ratings for minor errors in all metrics, and consider the following examples of high and low scores for each metric: for relevance, a high score would be a summary that accurately captures all key points and main arguments, while a low score would be a summary that misses crucial information or includes irrelevant details; for consistency, a high score would be a summary that accurately reproduces facts, while a low score would be a summary that introduces untrue information; for coherence, a high score would be a summary with sentences that fit together logically, while a low score would be a summary with disjointed or confusing sentences; for fluency, a high score would be a summary with well-written and grammatically correct sentences, while a low score would be a summary with poorly written or grammatically incorrect sentences; and for tone and sentiment, a high score would be a summary that accurately conveys the emotional tone and sentiment of the original article, while a low score would be a summary that fails to do so. Provide specific examples of high and low scores for each metric to guide your judgement and reduce inconsistencies.

Recommendations:
  1. Revise the instruction to emphasize harsher ratings for minor errors in all metrics, as the current mean_diff scores indicate leniency in judgement.
  2. Clarify the definition of coherence to better distinguish it from relevance, as the current instruction may lead to confusion between the two metrics.
  3. Emphasize the importance of evaluating the summary as a whole in the coherence metric, rather than just individual sentences, to better capture the overall quality of the summary.
  4. Provide more specific examples of high and low scores for each metric to guide the judgement and reduce inconsistencies.
  5. Revise the instruction to provide clearer guidance on evaluating tone and sentiment, as this metric appears to be the least emphasized in the current instruction.

Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its relevance, consistency, coherence, fluency, and tone and sentiment, ensuring that you accurately capture all and only the key points of the article without overestimating or underestimating their importance, and verify that the summary does not miss crucial information or include irrelevant details. When evaluating relevance, consider the importance of each key point and provide harsher ratings for summaries that miss crucial information or include irrelevant details, with a focus on penalizing minor errors, and evaluate the summary's ability to capture the main arguments or points of the original article, ensuring that all important aspects are covered. Evaluate consistency by meticulously verifying that the summary reproduces facts accurately and does not introduce untrue information, paying close attention to factual accuracy and ensuring that all statements are supported by the original article, with a focus on providing harsher ratings for minor errors in consistency. Assess coherence by considering the overall quality of the summary as a whole, ensuring that sentences fit together logically, sound natural, and form a cohesive narrative, while avoiding confusion with relevance, and providing harsher ratings for minor errors in coherence, with a focus on evaluating the summary as a whole rather than just individual sentences. Judge fluency by evaluating the quality of individual sentences, considering both grammatical correctness, the nuances of well-written sentences, the clarity of expression, and the overall readability and flow of the summary, avoiding overly simplistic assessments and ensuring that each sentence contributes to the overall quality of the summary, with a focus on providing harsher ratings for minor errors in fluency, and paying close attention to sentence-level evaluation to ensure accurate assessment of fluency. Evaluate tone and sentiment by considering whether the summary accurately conveys the emotional tone and sentiment of the original article, and provide harsher ratings for summaries that fail to do so. Provide harsher ratings for minor errors in all metrics, and consider the following examples of high and low scores for each metric: for relevance, a high score would be a summary that accurately captures all key points and main arguments, while a low score would be a summary that misses crucial information or includes irrelevant details; for consistency, a high score would be a summary that accurately reproduces facts, while a low score would be a summary that introduces untrue information; for coherence, a high score would be a summary with sentences that fit together logically, while a low score would be a summary with disjointed or confusing sentences; for fluency, a high score would be a summary with well-written and grammatically correct sentences, while a low score would be a summary with poorly written or grammatically incorrect sentences; and for tone and sentiment, a high score would be a summary that accurately conveys the emotional tone and sentiment of the original article, while a low score would be a summary that fails to do so. Provide specific examples of high and low scores for each metric to guide your judgement and reduce inconsistencies.

Recommendations:
  1. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize capturing key points of the article, and whether all the important aspects are covered, as the current instruction seems to be lenient in this aspect, with a mean_diff score of 1.984.
  2. Clarify the distinction between relevance and coherence in the instruction, as the provided examples suggest some overlap between the two metrics, which may lead to inconsistencies in ratings.
  3. Emphasize the importance of evaluating the summary as a whole, rather than just individual sentences, in the fluency metric, as the current instruction seems to focus too much on sentence-level evaluation.
  4. Provide more specific guidance on how to evaluate tone and sentiment, as the current instruction is somewhat vague, and the mean_diff score of 2.0435 suggests some inconsistencies in ratings.
  5. Consider adding more examples of high and low scores for each metric to guide the rater's judgement and reduce inconsistencies.
  6. Revise the instruction to provide harsher ratings for minor errors in consistency, as the current instruction seems to be lenient in this aspect, with a mean_diff score of 1.764.
  7. Emphasize the importance of evaluating the summary's ability to capture the main arguments or points of the original article in the relevance metric, as the current instruction seems to focus too much on penalizing minor errors.
