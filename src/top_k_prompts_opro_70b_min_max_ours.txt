Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its fluency, coherence, consistency, and relevance, ensuring that the summary accurately reproduces facts from the original article and captures its key points, while also evaluating the quality of individual sentences and the summary as a whole. When evaluating coherence, prioritize the logical connections between sentences and the overall flow of the summary, ensuring that it sounds natural and cohesive, while also considering the capture of key points and important aspects, and use examples or illustrations to illustrate the nuances of this metric, aiming for a CE_Coherence of 1.5 or lower. For consistency, explicitly compare the accuracy of facts in the summary to the original article, and consider factual errors such as incorrect names, dates, or events, penalizing more heavily for significant errors, and provide specific guidance on evaluating factual errors, such as: incorrect names (e.g., person, organization, location), incorrect dates (e.g., day, month, year), and incorrect events (e.g., actions, outcomes), aiming for a CE_Consistency of 1.1 or lower, and note that minor factual errors should not be heavily penalized. When rating fluency, prioritize overall sentence quality and be lenient towards minor errors in grammar or sentence structure, considering them as part of the evaluation but not penalizing for minor mistakes, such as: minor punctuation errors, slight grammatical errors, or minor sentence structure issues, but emphasize the importance of minor errors in grammar or sentence structure and provide clearer guidance on when to penalize for such mistakes, specifically penalizing only when errors significantly impact sentence clarity or meaning, aiming for a CE_Fluency of 1.4 or lower. Emphasize the importance of relevance by prioritizing the capture of the article's main points and key aspects, and provide specific guidance on how to evaluate relevance by focusing on the summary's ability to convey the essence of the original article, and evaluate the summary as a whole, rather than focusing on individual sentences, to ensure coherence and consistency, and consider how well the summary captures the logical connections between sentences, the overall flow, and the accuracy of facts, using a holistic approach to assess the summary's overall quality and effectiveness in conveying the original article's content, and prioritize the capture of key points and important aspects of the article, aiming for a CE_Relevance of 1.5 or lower, and use the following guidelines to ensure a balanced evaluation: prioritize coherence and consistency when the summary is well-structured and accurate, but lacks relevance; prioritize relevance when the summary captures the main points and key aspects, but lacks coherence and consistency; and prioritize fluency when the summary is well-written and clear, but lacks coherence, consistency, and relevance.

Recommendations: 
  1. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize the importance of logical connections between sentences and the overall flow of the summary, while also considering the capture of key points and important aspects, to reduce the CE_Coherence loss from 1.694 to 1.5 or lower.
  2. Refine the consistency instruction to provide clearer guidance on evaluating factual errors, such as incorrect names, dates, or events, and specify the level of penalty for significant errors, to reduce the CE_Consistency loss from 1.275 to 1.1 or lower.
  3. Adjust the fluency instruction to provide more specific guidance on when to penalize for minor errors in grammar or sentence structure, and emphasize the importance of minor errors in sentence clarity or meaning, to reduce the CE_Fluency loss from 1.794 to 1.4 or lower.
  4. Revise the relevance instruction to prioritize the capture of the article's main points and key aspects, and provide specific guidance on how to evaluate relevance by focusing on the summary's ability to convey the essence of the original article, to reduce the CE_Relevance loss from 1.656 to 1.5 or lower.

Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its fluency, coherence, consistency, and relevance, ensuring that the summary accurately reproduces facts from the original article and captures its key points, while also evaluating the quality of individual sentences and the summary as a whole. When evaluating coherence, prioritize the logical connections between sentences and the overall flow of the summary, ensuring that it sounds natural and cohesive, while also considering the capture of key points and important aspects, and use examples or illustrations to illustrate the nuances of this metric, aiming for a CE_Coherence of 1.5 or lower. For consistency, explicitly compare the accuracy of facts in the summary to the original article, and consider factual errors such as incorrect names, dates, or events, penalizing more heavily for significant errors, and provide specific guidance on evaluating factual errors, such as: incorrect names (e.g., person, organization, location), incorrect dates (e.g., day, month, year), and incorrect events (e.g., actions, outcomes), aiming for a CE_Consistency of 1.1 or lower, and note that minor factual errors, such as incorrect dates or events, should not be heavily penalized. When rating fluency, prioritize overall sentence quality and be lenient towards minor errors in grammar or sentence structure, considering them as part of the evaluation but not penalizing for minor mistakes, such as: minor punctuation errors, slight grammatical errors, or minor sentence structure issues, but emphasize the importance of minor errors in grammar or sentence structure and provide clearer guidance on when to penalize for such mistakes, specifically penalizing only when errors significantly impact sentence clarity or meaning, aiming for a CE_Fluency of 1.4 or lower. Emphasize the importance of relevance by prioritizing the capture of the article's main points and key aspects, and provide specific guidance on how to evaluate relevance by focusing on the summary's ability to convey the essence of the original article, and evaluate the summary as a whole, rather than focusing on individual sentences, to ensure coherence and consistency, and consider how well the summary captures the logical connections between sentences, the overall flow, and the accuracy of facts, using a holistic approach to assess the summary's overall quality and effectiveness in conveying the original article's content, and prioritize the capture of key points and important aspects of the article, aiming for a CE_Relevance of 1.5 or lower, and use the following guidelines to ensure a balanced evaluation: prioritize coherence and consistency when the summary is well-structured and accurate, but lacks relevance; prioritize relevance when the summary captures the main points and key aspects, but lacks coherence and consistency; and prioritize fluency when the summary is well-written and clear, but lacks coherence, consistency, and relevance.

Recommendations: 
  1. Revise the fluency instruction to provide clearer guidance on when to penalize for minor errors in grammar or sentence structure, as the model tends to be overly harsh, with a mean-diff score of -1 in multiple examples.
  2. Refine the coherence instruction to emphasize the importance of logical connections between sentences and the overall flow of the summary, as the model's coherence scores are inconsistent, with mean-diff scores ranging from -3 to 3.
  3. Adjust the relevance instruction to prioritize the capture of key points and important aspects of the article, as the model tends to be too lenient, with mean-diff scores of -1 and -3 in examples where the summary lacks relevance.
  4. Revise the consistency instruction to provide clearer guidance on evaluating factual errors, as the model tends to be overly harsh, with mean-diff scores of -3 and -1 in examples where the summary contains minor factual errors.
  5. Emphasize the importance of a holistic approach to evaluating summaries, considering all four metrics, as the model tends to focus too much on individual metrics, leading to inconsistent scores.
