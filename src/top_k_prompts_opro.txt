Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its relevance to the key points of the original article.

Metrics:
   relevance:
       accuracy: 0.0
       f1: 0.0

Recommendations:
1. Revise the relevance instruction to explicitly state that the rater should identify whether all and only the important aspects are contained in the summary, to better align with expert annotators.
2. Consider revising the scoring system to be more granular, such as using a 6-point scale or a qualitative framework, to capture more nuanced differences in relevance scores and reduce the likelihood of extreme scores (1 or 5) that may be counterintuitive for certain cases.
3. Provide a clear definition of what constitutes an "important aspect" of the article, and consider providing examples or non-examples to help guide the rater in their evaluation.

Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its relevance to the key points of the original article, considering whether all and only the important aspects, such as main events, key quotes, and supporting evidence, are accurately and comprehensively captured in the summary.

Metrics:
   relevance:
       accuracy: 0.1
       f1: 0.1

Recommendations:
1. Revise the relevance instruction to provide specific examples of main events, key quotes, and supporting evidence that should be accurately captured in the summary.
2. Consider adding a clarifying statement to emphasize that irrelevant information, such as tangential details or filler words, should not be considered when evaluating the summary's relevance.
3. Propose a clearer distinction between "important aspects" and "accurately and comprehensively captured," to ensure raters focus on the quality of summary content rather than its quantity.
4. Revise the instruction to guide raters on evaluating the summary's ability to condense the article's key information without introducing new information or altering the original meaning.
