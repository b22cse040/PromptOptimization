Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its consistency with the original article, considering the entire content, including subtle inferences and implications, and evaluating whether all aspects of the text are true to the original, including specific details such as names, dates, and locations. Penalize summaries that omit essential information, defined as critical facts that significantly impact the understanding of the article's main points, introduce untrue information, or contradict the original article, with heavier penalties for introducing untrue information. Ensure consistency ratings account for the accuracy of specific details, the presentation, and ordering of information, and uniformly penalize summaries that omit or introduce information that contradicts the original article.

Metrics:
   consistency:
       accuracy: 0.28
       f1: 0.334

Recommendations:
1. Revise the consistency instruction to focus more explicitly on the presence of specific factual inaccuracies, emphasizing the need to penalize summaries that introduce untrue information or contradict the original article, with specific examples of critical facts that significantly impact the understanding of the article's main points.
2. Emphasize the importance of accurate ordering and presentation of information in the instruction, as it appears that the model may be overlooking these aspects or not adequately penalizing summaries that alter the original context.
3. Clarify the definition of "essential information" and provide more guidance on what constitutes "critical facts" to ensure consistency in ratings across different samples and to address potential biases in omitting or introducing information.

Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its consistency with the original article, considering the entire content, including explicit statements, subtle inferences, and implications, and evaluating whether all aspects of the text are true to the original, including specific details such as names, dates, and locations. Define critical facts as information that significantly impacts the understanding of the article's main points, including key events, quotes, statistics, and specific details that alter the context or meaning. Penalize summaries that omit critical facts, introduce untrue information, or contradict the original article, with equal penalties for omitting critical facts and introducing untrue information, which includes fabricated facts, misinterpretations, or misrepresentations of original information. Ensure consistency ratings account for the accuracy of specific details, the presentation, and ordering of information, and uniformly penalize summaries that omit or introduce information that contradicts the original article. When evaluating consistency, consider whether the summary accurately reproduces the original article's facts, avoids introducing new information, presents information in a logical and coherent order, and maintains the original context and meaning. Provide specific guidance on what constitutes a consistent or inconsistent summary, including examples of direct factual inaccuracies versus interpretations that deviate from the original context, and consider the following thresholds: omitting or misrepresenting critical facts that significantly impact the understanding of the article's main points, introducing untrue information that alters the context or meaning, and presenting information in a non-logical or incoherent order.

Metrics:
   consistency:
       accuracy: 0.27
       f1: 0.331

Recommendations:
1. Revise the consistency instruction to emphasize the distinction between factual inaccuracies and interpretations that deviate from the original context, providing clear examples to guide the rater LLM in making this distinction.
2. Refine the definition of critical facts to prioritize key events, quotes, and statistics that significantly alter the context or meaning of the article, and provide guidance on how to penalize summaries that omit or misrepresent these critical facts.
3. Emphasize the importance of maintaining the original context and meaning in the summary, and provide guidance on how to evaluate whether the summary accurately reproduces the original article's facts and avoids introducing new information.
4. Consider revising the instruction to provide more explicit guidance on how to evaluate the presentation and ordering of information in the summary, and how to uniformly penalize summaries that present information in a non-logical or incoherent order.
5. Provide more specific guidance on the thresholds for penalizing summaries, including clear examples of when a summary should receive a lower consistency rating due to omitting or misrepresenting critical facts, introducing untrue information, or presenting information in a non-logical or incoherent order.
