Recommendations:
  1. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize 'logical transitions between sentences' and 'a natural flow of ideas', as the model struggles with coherence evaluation, indicating potential confusion about the scope of the metric.
  2. Emphasize in the relevance instruction that a summary should capture 'all and only' the important aspects, as the model tends to overrate relevance, suggesting it may be including non-essential information.
  3. Refine the consistency instruction to highlight the importance of 'accurate reproduction of facts' and 'absence of contradictory information', as the model's performance on consistency is subpar, indicating possible difficulties in distinguishing between accurate and inaccurate summaries.
  4. Expand the fluency instruction to include 'grammatical correctness' and 'clarity of expression', as the model's fluency scores are low, suggesting it may be struggling to evaluate sentence-level quality.
  5. Introduce guiding principles to help the model better align with expert annotators, such as evaluating summaries in the context of the original article and considering the target audience's needs and expectations.
