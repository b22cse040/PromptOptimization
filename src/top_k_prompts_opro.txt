Instruction:
Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its relevance, consistency with facts presented in the original article,
fluency of individual sentences, and coherence as a whole, with the goal of averaging these grades to a final score, emphasizing
logical transitions between sentences and grammatical correctness, while avoiding unnecessary information and ensuring key points are
captured, and providing explicit guidance on what constitutes factual accuracy.

Metrics:
   fluency:
       accuracy: 0.164
       f1: 0.104
       mean_diff: 0.327
   coherence:
       accuracy: 0.127
       f1: 0.063
       mean_diff: 1.345
   consistency:
       accuracy: 0.2
       f1: 0.196
       mean_diff: 1.164
   relevance:
       accuracy: 0.218
       f1: 0.189
       mean_diff: 1.127

Recommendations:

1. Revise the instruction on fluency to emphasize the importance of sentence structure, grammar, and overall sentence structure to better align with expert annotators' expectations, given the low accuracy (0.164) and F1 score (0.104).

2. Reconsider the instruction on coherence, as it seems to be a challenging metric, based on its low accuracy (0.127), F1 score (0.063), and high mean-difference (1.345). One possible solution is to revise the instruction to focus on the flow and logical connection between sentences, as there's no explicit guidance on this aspect.

3. As the accuracy and F1 score for consistency (0.2 and 0.196, respectively) are relatively low, consider clarifying the definition of consistency in the instruction to emphasize the importance of factoring in the original article's content.

4. The performance for relevance metric seems relatively stable, but the low mean-difference (1.127) indicates the rater might be too lenient. To address this, revise the instruction to provide more explicit guidance on what constitutes a relevant summary, potentially adding examples of well-crafted summaries that effectively capture the article's key points.

5. Due to the inconsistency in the mean-differences across all four metrics (fluency: 0.327; coherence: 1.345; consistency: 1.164; relevance: 1.127), it's essential to recommend adjustments to the overall instruction to achieve a better balance of scores and prevent rater biases.

   relevance:
       accuracy: 0.216
       f1: 0.207
       mean_diff: 1.196

Recommendations:
  1. Clarify the fluency metric to separate sentence-level clarity from grammatical correctness, as the current instruction emphasizes both aspects, which could lead to inconsistent ratings. For example, revise the fluency instruction to read "fluency and clarity of individual sentences, focusing on sentence structure, word choice, and grammar."
  
  2. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize "logical connections, transitional phrases, and overall flow, while also considering the relevance of each sentence to the article's key points", as the current instruction may lead to a bias towards overly lenient scores due to mean_diff of 1.549.
  
  3. Adjust the relevance instruction to prioritize "comprehensiveness of key points" over the absolute presence or absence of "unnecessary information", as the current formulation may result in scores being unduly influenced by non-essential omissions that do not affect the overall quality of the summary.
  
  4. Remove the redundancy by reformulating the instruction to avoid the repetition of aspects, especially with regard to grammatical correctness, which is already encompassed under the fluency metric. For example, replace the redundant clause "and overall text quality" with more distinct aspects that need emphasis.
