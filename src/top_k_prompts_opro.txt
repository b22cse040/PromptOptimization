Recommendations:

1. Revise the instruction to provide a clearer distinction between relevance and consistency. The current instruction mentions accuracy and precision, which may be too broad and confusing for the model. Consider rephrasing to focus on capturing the article's key points (relevance) versus accurately reproducing facts from the original article (consistency).

2. Emphasize the importance of coherence in the instruction. The poor performance on coherence (accuracy of 0.06, F1 of 0.03) suggests that the model may be misunderstanding what constitutes a coherent summary. Consider adding a specific phrase or guideline to help the model understand the connection between sentences and the role of logical transitions.
