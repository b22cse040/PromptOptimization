Recommendations:
  1. The LLM is being lenient in its judgement, as indicated by the positive mean_diff scores for most of the examples. To address this, the instruction could be revised to emphasize strictness in ratings, with a focus on accurately capturing the quality of the summaries. This could be achieved by adding phrases such as "err on the side of caution" or "be more critical in your evaluation."
  2. The instruction could be revised to clarify the definition of coherence, emphasizing the importance of capturing key points of the article and whether all the important aspects are covered. This could be achieved by adding phrases such as "ensure that the summary accurately reflects the main points of the article" or "evaluate the summary based on its ability to convey the essential information."
  3. The LLM appears to be inconsistent in its evaluation of consistency, as indicated by the large difference in Cross-Entropy Loss between Example 4 and the other examples. To address this, the instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on what constitutes consistent information, such as "evaluate the summary based on its accuracy and completeness of information, including factual accuracy and consistency with the original article."
  4. The LLM's evaluation of relevance is often inconsistent with the task-wise differences, as indicated by the large difference in Cross-Entropy Loss between Example 4 and the other examples. To address this, the instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on what constitutes relevant information, such as "evaluate the summary based on its ability to capture the key points of the article and avoid unnecessary information."
  5. The instruction could be revised to provide more guidance on how to evaluate fluency, such as "evaluate the summary based on its clarity, grammatical correctness, and overall flow, requiring clear and concise language." This could help to reduce the Cross-Entropy Loss for fluency and improve the overall performance of the LLM.

Recommendations:
1. The LLM is being lenient in its ratings, as indicated by the positive mean-diff scores for fluency, coherence, consistency, and relevance. To address this, we recommend increasing the ratings to reflect the actual quality of the summaries, particularly for Example 5, where the machine summary received a high coherence score despite lacking key information.
2. The instruction emphasizes strictness in ratings, but the LLM's performance suggests a lack of clarity in the coherence metric. We recommend revising the coherence instruction to emphasize capturing key points of the article and whether all the important aspects are covered, as well as the logical and well-connected structure of the summary.
3. The LLM's performance on Example 5 suggests a bias towards relevance over coherence, as the machine summary received a high relevance score despite lacking key information. We recommend revising the relevance instruction to prioritize the importance and relevance of each point, rather than solely focusing on whether the summary captures key points of the article.
4. The LLM's performance on Example 1 suggests a lack of attention to consistency, as the machine summary failed to capture key information about Gemma's behavior and her relationship with her mother. We recommend revising the consistency instruction to emphasize the accuracy and completeness of information, including factual accuracy and consistency with the original article.
5. The LLM's performance on Example 2 suggests a lack of attention to fluency, as the machine summary received a low fluency score despite being grammatically correct. We recommend revising the fluency instruction to emphasize the overall flow and clarity of the summary, rather than solely focusing on grammatical correctness.

Recommendations:
1. The LLM is being lenient in its ratings, as indicated by the positive mean-diff scores for fluency, coherence, consistency, and relevance. To address this, we recommend increasing the ratings to reflect the actual quality of the summaries, particularly for Example 1 and Example 5, where the machine summaries are significantly different from the ground truth.
2. The instruction emphasizes strictness in ratings, but the LLM's performance suggests that it is not adhering to this principle. We recommend revising the instruction to clarify that ratings should be strict and not lenient, and that the LLM should aim to accurately capture the quality of the summaries.
3. The LLM is struggling with coherence, as evident from the high cross-entropy loss and the significant differences in coherence scores across examples. We recommend revising the coherence instruction to emphasize capturing key points of the article and whether all the important aspects are covered, as well as the logical and well-connected structure of the summary.
4. The LLM is inconsistent in its ratings, as seen in Example 2, where the relevance score is 1, while the other scores are -1. We recommend revising the relevance instruction to clarify that it should be evaluated based on whether the summary captures the key points of the article, avoids unnecessary information, and prioritizes the importance and relevance of each point.
5. The LLM is biased towards leniency in its ratings, as indicated by the positive mean-diff scores. We recommend revising the instruction to emphasize the importance of accuracy and strictness in ratings, and to provide clear guidelines for evaluating the quality of the summaries.

Recommendations: 
  1. Decrease the strictness in ratings, as the LLM is being too harsh in its evaluation, indicated by the negative mean-diff scores in all examples. This could be achieved by revising the instruction to emphasize the importance of capturing the key points of the article, rather than strictly evaluating the summary's quality.
  2. Revise the coherence instruction to emphasize capturing key points of the article, and whether all the important aspects are covered. This could help the LLM better align with expert annotators and improve the Cross-Entropy Loss of coherence.
  3. Clarify the instruction to ensure that the LLM is evaluating the summary based on its ability to convey the essential information, rather than just focusing on the importance and relevance of each point. This could help reduce the Cross-Entropy Loss of relevance.
  4. Consider revising the fluency instruction to provide more guidance on what constitutes clear and concise language, as the current instruction may be too vague. This could help the LLM better evaluate the fluency of the summary.
